Hi, my name is jory hadi alharbi.
I am a Computer Science student at Taibah University, and this is my project for the Health Innvonation Hackathon (6th Edition) held in Riyadh, organized by KSAU.

Project Overview: 
The project is a web-based prototype application designed to monitor real-time health signals from an IoT device.
The main goal is to track patient vitals, detect abnormal readings, and provied real-time alerts to the user.

How it works: 
1- The application receives real-time signals from a real IoT device.
2- It calculates and analyzes the readings to determine if they are normal or abnormal.
3- If critical or dangerous reading is detected, the system immediately sends an alert or warning message to the user.
4- All reading are stored and displayed in a history section, allowing users (patients/healthcare providers) to review past data.

Future use:
This project is intended to be used by healthcare providers in the future. It can help in: 
~ Remote patient monitoring.
~ Early detection of critacl conditions.
~ Quick medical intervention.
~ Tracking patient history.

Technologies used:
Python (backend)
Web-based interface (frontend for real-time display and history)
IoT device integration (real-time signal input)

Eventually, this project is currently a simple prototype and not the final product.
It shows the concept and functionality of a real-time patient monitoring system.
Thanks ^-^!
